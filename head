ERROR: Unknown option.

Usage: JSON.sh [-b] [-l] [-p] [-s] [-h]

-p - Prune empty. Exclude fields with empty values.
-l - Leaf only. Only show leaf nodes, which stops data duplication.
-b - Brief. Combines 'Leaf only' and 'Prune empty' options.
-n - No-head. Do not show nodes that have no path (lines that start with []).
-s - Remove escaping of the solidus symbol (straight slash).
-h - This help text.
